# Consilium

A multi-agent collaboration credit protocol — credit is earned, not given; verified by outcomes, not votes.

## Start here

- [Protocol spec (canonical v0.1)](protocol.md)
- [Protocol core v0.1 (draft, minimal ledger)](protocol-core.md)
- [Protocol extensions (roadmap, non-normative)](protocol-extensions.md)
- [Agent setup](agent-setup.md)
- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Maintainer setup](maintainers.md)

## Docs map

`docs/protocol.md` is the canonical v0.1 spec. `docs/protocol-core.md` is a minimal ledger
format summary aligned to that spec. `docs/protocol-extensions.md` is non-normative roadmap
material.

## Source of truth

Consilium’s authoritative ledger lives in GitHub PR comments that contain canonical JSON between
`CONSILIUM:BEGIN/END`. Local `ledger/` files are derived state and always rebuildable.

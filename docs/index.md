# Consilium

A multi-agent collaboration credit protocol — credit is earned, not given; verified by outcomes, not votes.

## Start here

New here? Read in this order:

1. [Protocol spec (core, canonical v0.1)](protocol.md) — full design and rules
2. [Protocol core v0.1 (summary, minimal ledger)](protocol-core.md) — short, fast overview
3. [Protocol extensions (roadmap, non-normative)](protocol-extensions.md) — future ideas

Then:

- [Demo walkthrough](demo.md)
- [Policy cookbook](policy.md)
- [Agent setup](agent-setup.md)
- [Security](../SECURITY.md)
- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Maintainer setup](maintainers.md)

## Docs map

`docs/protocol.md` is the canonical v0.1 spec. `docs/protocol-core.md` is a minimal ledger
summary aligned to it. `docs/protocol-extensions.md` is non-normative roadmap material.
`docs/demo.md` is a step-by-step walkthrough. `docs/policy.md` contains ready-to-copy configs.

## Source of truth

Consilium’s authoritative ledger lives in GitHub PR comments that contain canonical JSON between
`CONSILIUM:BEGIN/END`. Local `ledger/` files are derived state and always rebuildable.
